Description: Provides convenience functions to communicate with
    an Experigen server: Experigen (<http://github.com/aquincum/experigen>)
    is an online framework for creating  linguistic experiments,
    and it stores the results on a dedicated server. This package can be
    used to retrieve the results from the server, and it is especially
    helpful with registered experiments, as authentication with the server
    has to happen.
